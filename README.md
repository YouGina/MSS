MainServiceScan

A scanning tool for internal usage on our hosting platform. It finds malicious files and function calls and identifies obfuscated files for manual audition using UNC paths in an shared environment.

This Github project has been set up for the EC-Council delta team and contains a simplified version of the tool we use.
